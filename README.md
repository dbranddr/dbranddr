I am a <b>Lead Designer (Brand & product)</b> with years of professional experience in Design and have a track record in brand communication, Frontend Development, Product Strategy, User Experience/ Interface Design, and Content Development on a global scale.

<p>I am a firm believer in the growth of communities and community-led events and as such has given talks/workshops at Microsoft Student Community, Google Developers conferences; at GitHub Campus Bootcamp, Anambra Tech community, and Unizik Blockchain Lab etc, all to the goal of expanding the African Tech Ecosystem</p> 

Currently i am satisfying my hunger to be the <font COLOR="#ffcc00"> best designer in blockchain as a Product designer at Imbue Network, a web3 gig platform </font>
